📊 Python Data Analysis & Visualization Assignment
📌 Overview

This project is a Python-based data analysis and visualization assignment.
It demonstrates how to:

Load and explore datasets using pandas

Perform basic data analysis

Visualize data using matplotlib

The notebook/script walks through each step — from loading raw data to presenting meaningful insights visually.

🎯 Objectives

Load and explore a dataset in CSV format

Analyze data using statistical methods and grouping

Visualize patterns and relationships using different types of charts

2. Navigate into the project folder:

cd <your-repo-name>

or run the Python script:

python assignment.py

📊 Features

Dataset loading and cleaning

Basic statistics and descriptive analysis

Grouped aggregations and summaries

Visualizations:

  Line chart (time-series trends)

  Bar chart (category comparisons)

  Histogram (distribution analysis)

  Scatter plot (relationships between variables)

📌 Findings

The notebook includes short notes and observations based on the visualizations and analysis results.
These highlight any patterns, trends, or outliers found in the dataset.

If you want, I can also automatically generate this README.md file and push it to your repo for you.

Would you like me to do that?

Perfect! 💪

Before I create and push the README.md for you, I just need a few quick details to personalize it:

✅ Your GitHub repo name (the one you created for this assignment)

✍️ The name you want shown as Author (should I use your full name or GitHub username?)

📁 The dataset file name you used (e.g. iris.csv, sales.csv, etc.)

Once you give me these three details, I’ll generate the ready-to-push README.md for your repo.

If you want, I can also make it a bit fancier by adding a preview of your plots (images) and badges.
Would you like me to do that after pushing?
